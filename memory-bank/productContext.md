## User Stories
### Cell Dependency Management
1. As a financial analyst, I want formulas to automatically update when referenced cells change, so that my spreadsheet always shows accurate results.
2. As a data analyst, I want to be notified of circular dependencies in my formulas, so that I can fix them before they cause calculation errors.
3. As a power user, I want formula evaluation to be fast even with complex dependencies, so that I can work efficiently with large datasets.

### Collaboration
1. As a team lead, I want to control who can view or edit my spreadsheets, so that I can protect sensitive data.
2. As a project manager, I want to see real-time updates when team members modify shared spreadsheets, so that I always have the latest information.
3. As a financial team member, I want to work on the same spreadsheet simultaneously with colleagues, so that we can collaborate efficiently on financial models.

### Performance
1. As a user with large spreadsheets, I want the application to remain responsive even with thousands of cells and complex formulas.
2. As a business analyst, I want formula recalculations to happen quickly after data changes, so that I can see results immediately.
3. As a system administrator, I want the application to efficiently use server resources, so that it can support many concurrent users.

## Acceptance Criteria
