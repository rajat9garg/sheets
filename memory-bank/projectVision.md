## Vision Statement
Sheets aims to be a high-performance, collaborative spreadsheet application that enables teams to work efficiently with complex data and formulas. By providing robust cell dependency management, efficient formula evaluation, and real-time collaboration features, Sheets will empower users to create, analyze, and share spreadsheet data with confidence and ease.

## Strategic Goals
1. **Performance Excellence**
   - Deliver responsive formula evaluation even with complex dependencies
   - Optimize caching strategies for frequently accessed data
   - Implement asynchronous updates to prevent UI blocking
   - Achieve sub-200ms response times for standard operations

2. **Robust Formula Evaluation**
   - Support industry-standard formula syntax and functions
   - Implement comprehensive cell dependency tracking
   - Provide clear error handling and reporting
   - Prevent circular dependencies and other common formula issues

3. **Seamless Collaboration**
   - Enable real-time collaborative editing
   - Implement fine-grained access control
   - Provide conflict resolution mechanisms
   - Support change tracking and history

4. **Scalable Architecture**
   - Design for horizontal scalability
   - Implement efficient data storage and retrieval
   - Optimize for large spreadsheets with thousands of cells
   - Support high concurrent user counts

## Success Metrics
### Performance Metrics
- **Formula Evaluation Time:** < 100ms for standard formulas
- **Cell Update Response Time:** < 200ms
- **Dependency Resolution Time:** < 50ms
