## Work Session: 2025-06-03 23:11
**Duration:** 1 hour
**AI Agent:** Cascade
**Session Focus:** Complete Alphabetical Column Transition in Expression Functions

### ‚úÖ Completed This Session
- [23:00] Enhanced MaxFunction to support A1 notation cell references and ranges
- [23:05] Added support for legacy numeric references in MaxFunction with conversion to A1 notation
- [23:07] Implemented range processing in MaxFunction similar to SumFunction pattern
- [23:08] Added detailed logging in MaxFunction for better debugging and traceability
- [23:09] Built and tested the application with all expression functions
- [23:10] Verified that all tests pass with SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, and arithmetic operations

### üö´ Blocked Items
- Performance testing with large spreadsheets and complex formulas
- Edge case testing for unusual formula patterns
- Optimization of formula evaluation for better performance

### ‚û°Ô∏è Next Agent Must Do
1. Implement comprehensive unit tests for all expression functions
2. Optimize formula evaluation performance, especially for large cell ranges
3. Consider refactoring common code in function implementations to reduce duplication
4. Add support for more advanced functions (e.g., COUNTIF, SUMIF, VLOOKUP)

## Key Decisions
### 2025-06-03 - Alphabetical Column Notation Implementation
**Issue/Context:** Need to transition from numeric column references (1:1) to alphabetical notation (A1)  
**Decision:** Implement consistent A1 notation support across all expression functions  
**Rationale:** A1 notation is more user-friendly and industry-standard for spreadsheet applications  
**Impact:** Improved user experience with familiar notation and consistent behavior  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2025-06-02 - Cell Dependency Management Strategy
**Issue/Context:** Need to efficiently track and update cell dependencies in spreadsheets  
**Decision:** Implement dual-storage approach with MongoDB for persistence and Redis for caching  
**Rationale:** Redis provides fast access for frequently used dependencies while MongoDB ensures durability  
**Impact:** Improved performance for cell dependency lookups and updates with 24-hour TTL for cache entries  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2025-06-02 - Asynchronous Cell Updates
**Issue/Context:** Updating dependent cells synchronously causes performance issues with complex dependencies  
**Decision:** Implement asynchronous updates for dependent cells using Spring's @Async annotation  
**Rationale:** Allows the main thread to return quickly while updates happen in the background  
**Impact:** Improved user experience with faster response times for cell updates  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2025-06-02 - Circular Dependency Detection
**Issue/Context:** Formula evaluation can cause infinite loops with circular dependencies  
**Decision:** Implement depth-first search algorithm to detect circular dependencies  
**Rationale:** DFS efficiently detects cycles in dependency graphs before evaluation  
**Impact:** Prevents application crashes due to stack overflow errors  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2025-06-02 - Remove Foreign Key Constraints
**Issue/Context:** Foreign key constraints on `sheets.user_id` and `access_mappings.user_id` causing errors when using non-existent user IDs  
**Decision:** Remove foreign key constraints to allow user IDs not present in users table  
**Rationale:** Enables testing and development without requiring user creation first  
**Impact:** Reduced data integrity guarantees but increased flexibility for development  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2025-06-02 - PostgreSQL Enum Type Handling
**Issue/Context:** PostgreSQL enum `access_type` missing the `OWNER` value present in Kotlin `AccessType` enum  
**Decision:** Create migration to recreate the enum type with all values including `OWNER`  
**Rationale:** Align database enum type with domain model to avoid runtime errors  
**Impact:** Requires explicit casting in SQL queries using `?::access_type` syntax  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2025-06-02 - Domain Model and Database ID Type Mismatch
**Issue/Context:** Domain models use UUID for IDs while database uses BIGINT for some tables  
**Decision:** Handle conversion between UUID and BIGINT in repository layer  
**Rationale:** Maintain type safety in domain model while preserving existing database schema  
**Impact:** Additional conversion logic in repository implementations  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2025-05-24 - Temporary Disable Flyway
**Issue/Context:** Flyway 9.16.1 has compatibility issues with PostgreSQL 15.13  
**Decision:** Disabled Flyway auto-configuration as a temporary workaround  
**Rationale:** Needed to unblock development while compatibility issues are resolved  
**Impact:** Database migrations need to be managed manually until Flyway is re-enabled  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2025-05-24 - PostgreSQL Version Selection
**Issue/Context:** Need to balance latest features with tooling compatibility  
**Decision:** Downgraded from PostgreSQL 16.9 to 15.13  
**Rationale:** Better compatibility with existing tooling and libraries  
**Impact:** Application now uses PostgreSQL 15.13 instead of the latest version  
**Status:** Implemented
