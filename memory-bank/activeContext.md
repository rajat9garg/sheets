- Updated memory-bank to document current progress and issues

### 2025-06-02 (Earlier)

- Fixed type mismatch between UUIDs in domain model and BIGINT IDs in PostgreSQL
- Updated repository methods to properly cast string values to PostgreSQL enum type
- Added robust exception handling and detailed logging in repository implementations
- Temporarily disabled owner-related functionality in service layer to avoid runtime errors

### 2025-05-24
- Downgraded PostgreSQL from 16.9 to 15.13 for better tooling compatibility

## Key Decisions
### 2025-06-02 - Cell Dependency Management Strategy
**Issue/Context:** Need to efficiently track and update cell dependencies in spreadsheets  
**Decision:** Implement dual-storage approach with MongoDB for persistence and Redis for caching  
**Rationale:** Redis provides fast access for frequently used dependencies while MongoDB ensures durability  
**Impact:** Improved performance for cell dependency lookups and updates with 24-hour TTL for cache entries  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2025-06-02 - Asynchronous Cell Updates
**Issue/Context:** Updating dependent cells synchronously causes performance issues with complex dependencies  
**Decision:** Implement asynchronous updates for dependent cells using Spring's @Async annotation  
**Rationale:** Allows the main thread to return quickly while updates happen in the background  
**Impact:** Improved user experience with faster response times for cell updates  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2025-06-02 - Circular Dependency Detection
**Issue/Context:** Formula evaluation can cause infinite loops with circular dependencies  
**Decision:** Implement depth-first search algorithm to detect circular dependencies  
**Rationale:** DFS efficiently detects cycles in dependency graphs before evaluation  
**Impact:** Prevents application crashes due to stack overflow errors  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2025-06-02 - Remove Foreign Key Constraints
**Issue/Context:** Foreign key constraints on `sheets.user_id` and `access_mappings.user_id` causing errors when using non-existent user IDs  
**Decision:** Remove foreign key constraints to allow user IDs not present in users table  
**Rationale:** Enables testing and development without requiring user creation first  
**Impact:** Reduced data integrity guarantees but increased flexibility for development  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2025-06-02 - PostgreSQL Enum Type Handling
**Issue/Context:** PostgreSQL enum `access_type` missing the `OWNER` value present in Kotlin `AccessType` enum  
**Decision:** Create migration to recreate the enum type with all values including `OWNER`  
**Rationale:** Align database enum type with domain model to avoid runtime errors  
**Impact:** Requires explicit casting in SQL queries using `?::access_type` syntax  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2025-06-02 - Domain Model and Database ID Type Mismatch
**Issue/Context:** Domain models use UUID for IDs while database uses BIGINT for some tables  
**Decision:** Handle conversion between UUID and BIGINT in repository layer  
**Rationale:** Maintain type safety in domain model while preserving existing database schema  
**Impact:** Additional conversion logic in repository implementations  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2025-05-24 - Temporary Disable Flyway
**Issue/Context:** Flyway 9.16.1 has compatibility issues with PostgreSQL 15.13  
**Decision:** Disabled Flyway auto-configuration as a temporary workaround  
**Rationale:** Needed to unblock development while compatibility issues are resolved  
**Impact:** Database migrations need to be managed manually until Flyway is re-enabled  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2025-05-24 - PostgreSQL Version Selection
**Issue/Context:** Need to balance latest features with tooling compatibility  
**Decision:** Downgraded from PostgreSQL 16.9 to 15.13  
**Rationale:** Better compatibility with existing tooling and libraries  
**Impact:** Application now uses PostgreSQL 15.13 instead of the latest version  
**Status:** Implemented
